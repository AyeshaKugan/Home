				<h2 id="Yarn">Yarn</h2>
				<p>There are various types of yarn in different weights, fibers and colours.</p>

		<h2 id="Needles">Knitting Needles</h2>
		<p>A pair of needles is all you need to start knitting. There are three different kinds of needles to choose from; straight needles, double-pointed needles, and circular needles. The needles you use depend on what you're making.</p>
		<div class="container">

				<img src="images/Straight.JPG" alt="Image of Straight needles">
			</div>
			<div class="text">
			<h3>Straight Needles</h3>
			<p> If you're a beginner, I would recommend straight needles as they have stoppers at both ends. Straight needles are used for rectangular projects that are knit flat.

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<h3>Double-Pointed needles</h3>
				<p>As the name suggests, double-pointed needles have points on both ends rather than having a stopper on one end. They are used for small projects joined in the round.				
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="images/Circular.JPG" alt="Image of Circular Needles">
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<h3>Circular Needles</h3>
				<p>Circular Needles are two needles connected with a cord. They are used for larger projects, as the cord allows them to hold more stitches, as well as knitting in the round.

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<h2 id="Hook">Crochet Hook</h2>
				<p>Crochet hooks are obviously used when crocheting, but are also helpful if you want to pick up dropped stitches while knitting or weaving in ends.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<h2 id="Tapestry">Tapestry Needle</h2>
				<p>Also known as a darning needle, tapestry needles are simply large sewing needles with a big eye that&rsquo;ll fit bulky yarn. They're used to weave in yarn tails and also to sew together different pieces of yarn.</p>
			</div>

				<img src="images/Scissors.JPG" alt="Image of a pair of scissors">
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<h2 id="Scissors">Scissors</h2>
				<p>You'll need scissors to cut the yarn at the end of your project or if you change colours in the middle. Any pair of scissors work, but as you become more advanced, small sharp scissors are your best option.</p>

				<h2 id="Measuring-Tape">Measuring Tape</h2>
				<p>Measuring tapes are used to measure the length of your piece.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 id="Markers">Stich Markers</h2>
		<p>Commonly used when knitting or crocheting in a round, stitch markers are used to mark a certain point in your work.</p>
		<h2 id="Holders">Stitch Holders</h2>
		<p>A stitch holder is like a giant safety pin. It's used to hold stitches you're not using aside to keep them from unravelling.</p>
