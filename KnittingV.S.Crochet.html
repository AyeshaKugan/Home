		<h1>Knitting v.s. Crochet</h1>
		<h2>Which is Better?</h2>
		<p>A commonly asked question for people who are looking to get into knitting and crochet is, which one is better? One isn't necessarily better than the other, although both come with their fair share of pros and cons.</p>

				<h3>Knitting Pros:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A majority of people find knitting easier to learn, although this really depends on the individual.</li>
					<li>Knitted items usually stretch more and flow more than crocheted items.</li>
					<li>If you&rsquo;re an experienced knitter, you can make high-quality items that look store-bought.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Knitting Cons:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It&rsquo;s easier to drop stitches in your project, which can ruin the entire thing.</li>
					<li>Knitting requires lots of patience, is required as it takes a long time.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Crochet Pros:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Crocheting only requires one hook rather than two needles. Having fewer materials can prevent you from losing or dropping them.</li>						
					<li>Crocheting is easier to do after learning the basics, and most people end up preferring it.</li>
					<li>Crochet stitches don't come apart as easily as knitted stitches.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Crochet Cons:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Projects usually require more yarn, making them more expensive in the long run.</li>
					<li>It&rsquo;s harder to find crochet patterns on the internet compared to knitting patterns.</li>
				</ul>

		<p>Which one you use is up to you and your personal preferences. Certain projects can only be made by crocheting and some only by knitting, depending on what the pattern calls for. I personally prefer knitting more when making clothes, although I prefer crocheting when it comes to amigurumi.</p>
