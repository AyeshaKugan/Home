		<h1>Knitting and Crochet</h1>
		<p>Knitting and crocheting are both popular craft hobbies among people of all ages, not just the elderly as it is commonly known to be. They&rsquo;re fun, relaxing and a great creative outlet. But the best part? Your final product is something you will actually use. </p>

				<p>Knitting loops yarn together to create a fabric. This fabric is made into various shapes that can be used to create things like clothes are blankets. Knitting can be done by either machine or hand. Crocheting is often lumped together with knitting, and although they do have some similarities, they are both two different things. While both create a fabric that can be shaped into different things, the fabric has different qualities, such as texture and elasticity, that can affect the final outcome of your project. For this reason, certain items are often knitted rather than crocheted, and vice versa.</p>
