		<h1>Knitting in the Round</h1>
		<p>There are three different types of needles used when knitting; straight, doubled pointed, and circular. When using straight needles, you can only knit flat, two&#8211;dimensional pieces. They are great for beginners, but as you become a more advanced knitter, I would recommend getting double-pointed needles(DPNs) or circular needles. These are used to knit in the round, which allows you to make tubes while you knit. Rounds are used when making socks, hats, and even sweaters. While you can knit these items flat, it requires an extra step of sewing. When knitting flat, you knit one row (the right side), then flip it around and knit the back (the wrong side). Knitting in the round, however you never turn your work and are always knitting on the right side. This makes knitting in the round a lot faster than knitting flat.</p>
		<h2>Circular Needles vs. Double-Pointed Needles</h2>
		<p>Aside from how they look, both needles are used to make different items in the round. Double-pointed needles are used to knit smaller items in the round, like socks, gloves, and hats, while circular needles are used for larger items like sweaters. Circular needles are often also used flat to knit larger items such as blankets, as the cord allows it to hold more stitches.</p>
		<h2>Knitting with Double-Pointed Needles</h2>
		<p>As the name implies, double-pointed needles have points on both ends allowing you to knit from both sides of it. This helps connect them in the round. Double pointed needles usually come in sets of four or five. The instructions below are written for a set of four, although the same steps apply if you are using five needles. </p>

				<p>Step 8: After you've finished knitting from needle 1, turn the needles so that the working yarn is on the right again.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Repeat steps 4 - 7 for the remaining two needles. Once you've finished knitting the stitches from all three needles, you've completed one row.</p>
		<p>Repeat steps 4 - 8 until your piece is as long as you desire. Once you've finished, cast off and weave in the tails on the wrong side of the work.</p>
		<h2>Knitting with Circular Needles</h2>
		<p>Circular needles are basically two straight needles except instead of stoppers that have a cord connecting them, allowing you to knit seamless tubes.</p>

		<p>Repeat steps 4 – 6 until your piece is as long as you want it. When you're done, cast off and weave in the tails on the wrong side of the work.</p>
