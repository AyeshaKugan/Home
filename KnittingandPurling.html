		<h1>Knitting and Purling</h1>
		<p> There are three steps to knitting; the cast-on, the knit or purl stitch, and the cast-off. 	
		<h2>The Cast-On</h2>
		<p>Casting-on is the very first step to knitting. It&rsquo;s the start of all your stitches and the set-up for the project. There are various ways to cast-on, but here you'll be learning the long tail cast-on method which is arguably the best cast-on.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<p>Step 1: Start off with a slip knot. Make sure you leave a long tail behind. Place the slip knot on your needle and hold it in your right hand.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Step 2: You now have 2 strands of yarn coming from your needle. The working yarn (that is attached to the ball) and the tail. Make sure the tail is facing you.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Step 3: Put your thumb and index finger in between both strands. Wrap your remaining three fingers around both yarn strands.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<p>Step 6: Then pick up the stitch wrapped around your index finger.</p>
			</div>			
		</div>
		<p>Step 7: Put your needle out through the loop around your thumb and take your thumb out. Pull on the strands to tighten your stitch and you've completed one!</p>
		<p>Step 8: Repeat steps 3 - 7 until you've reached you're desired about of stitches. Remember the slip-knot you made at the beginning counts as one stitch.</p>
		<h2>Knitting</h2>
		<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished the cast-on, you begin the actual making of your piece. Here you can either knit, purl, or do a combination of both to create pattern. First we'll learn how to knit.</p>

			</div>			
		</div>

			</div>			
		</div>
		<p>Knit&sol;purl one stitch and repeat until one stitch remains on your right needle. Cut a long yarn tail and wrap it around your right needle. Pull your yarn tail through the last stitch to close your work.</p>

		<p>And it's done&excl; If you wish you can tie a knot to secure your work, although if done properly your work shouldn't unravel. You can weave in your ends and cut off the tails to neaten your work.</p>
